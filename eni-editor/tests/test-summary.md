## Known Test Limitations

### Areas Not Fully Testable
1. **Actual SSH Connections**: Tests simulate SSH operations without real SSH servers
2. **TLS Certificate Validation**: Tests use mock certificates
3. **File System Operations**: Limited by test environment
4. **Network Timeouts**: Difficult to simulate in test environment
5. **Long-running Operations**: Limited by test execution time

### Future Test Enhancements
1. **Mock SSH Server**: Add mock SSH server for realistic SSH testing
2. **Certificate Generation**: Generate valid test certificates
3. **Database Stress Testing**: More intensive database load testing
4. **Memory Leak Detection**: Add memory usage monitoring
5. **Browser Testing**: Add frontend UI testing with Playwright

## Maintenance

### Regular Test Maintenance
1. Update test data patterns as application evolves
2. Adjust performance benchmarks based on infrastructure
3. Add new tests for new features
4. Review and update security tests for new threats
5. Monitor test execution times and optimize slow tests

### Test Debugging
1. Use `--debug` flag for step-by-step debugging
2. Check server logs for detailed error information
3. Use `--headed` flag to see browser interactions
4. Add console.log statements for debugging specific issues
